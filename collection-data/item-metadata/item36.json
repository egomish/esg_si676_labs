He delivered Route 1 for two years and is on his fourth year of Route 2, which is a 70-mile route with approximately 600 boxes. Presar, who is bi-racial, spoke about racism and bigotry from some customers, how work with the Postal Service compares to his previous work in logistics and deliveries for private companies, encounters with wildlife, including bears, while on the route, and the importance of the Postal Service in rural communities."
