        "Like books and magazines in the Library's general collections, this set of websites complements the original and historical visual material held in the Prints &amp; Photographs Division. Included are sites for photographers and cartoonists represented in P&amp;P (e.g., Kuper, Prokudin-Gorskii, Rogovin, and Telnaes). Also, websites for new digital image formats (e.g., Wrist photography, Reicholdarts cell phone photos, and Micah Wright remix posters). Other sites document new ways of displaying the visual arts through virtual galleries (e.g., Alternative Museum) and new ways of representing architectural work and the built environment (e.g., McKissack, Pritzker Prize, Vergara's Invincible Cities, and Vi&#241;oly). Major then-current event themes include views of Kurdistan and the Iraq War."

He explains different types of tobacco used to make cigars; how growing shade tobacco is more work, but more remunerative; buying his farm; economics and risks of tobacco farming; his history of his sheds; etc."
