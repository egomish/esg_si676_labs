        "Diane Cho discusses her current position as a principal architect Cho Benn Holback, a Quinn Evans Company in Baltimore, Maryland, that primarily focuses on work in the arts field. Cho talks about her early interest in museums and urban culture; and of being one of few women and only person of color in her architectural program at Cornell University. Following graduation, she explains how she moved to Baltimore with friend and fellow architecture student Barbara Wilks, lured by the challenge of redeveloping the city's neglected historic building stock. Initially finding work with a small architecture firm and the City of Baltimore Planning Department, she talks about learning about the city and the friends' decision to open their own architecture firm, Cho Wilks. Working with a local developer, the firm expanded rapidly and attracted notice for the rehabilitation and creative adaptation of existing historic structures into dwellings, condominiums, offices and retail shops. Cho discusses the challenges of running an architecture firm; of working with contractors and overseeing complicated projects; of being responsible for staff livelihoods, and of balancing these professional demands with being a mother. She highlights some of her favorite cultural arts projects--Center Stage, Everyman Theater, and the Baltimore School for the Arts--and explains how serving on numerous arts boards helps her to better understand her client's needs."
