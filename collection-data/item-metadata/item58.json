        "Gordie Keenan was born in 1954, in Norfolk, Virginia. He was educated in Rochester, New York, and later attended the State University of New York Maritime College. He moved to Houston in 1991 and has worked for Higman Marine Services, Inc. since 2005, where he was asked to run the personnel side of the business. Keenan describes his maritime career working different roles at Exxon and in several privately-owned towboat companies. He provides insight into ways the towboat industry has reformed itself to become more professional over the last few decades. This interview was accompanied by two photographs of employees: Douglas Dunn, pilot (with Gordie Keenan); Randall Spann, steersman; and Sean McDonald, steersman, of Higman Marine Services, Inc."
