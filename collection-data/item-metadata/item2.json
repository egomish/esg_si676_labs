        "As early as elementary school, Carlton C. Douglass knew that he wanted to be a funeral service professional. In this interview, Douglass, a five-plus decade licensee, speaks about the exorbitant cost of dying in the twenty-first century, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in African American communities, and how this public health emergency differed from other emergencies in the U.S. since the 1940s and 1950s. Mr. Douglass\u2019 funeral home is in the Gwynn Oak Neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Before filming, the interview started with an introduction and the recording commenced mid-conversation."

The first woman to complete the NPS Preservation Trades Training Program at Williamsport, Maryland (a three year hands-on training program in carpentry, joinery, masonry, roofing and building trades used for the preservation, stabilization and restoration of historic structures), she describes her multi-faceted work for NPS as an architect, construction crew chief, tradesperson in the field, manager, and hands-on trainer. She also discusses her involvement and leadership roles with organizations such as the Preservation Trades Network and the Timber Framers Guild that encourage collaborations between architects and tradespeople. Recently retired, she discusses how she continues to do consulting work through her company, Quid Tum-Historic Structures Consulting, as well as conduct field training for NPS employees."

She talks about her interest in sustainability, \"green\" building design, and the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) software. Now retired, she highlights some of her favorite projects, such as the Federal Center South building in Seattle that responded to its natural environment. She reflects on her childhood interest in architecture and construction; her first career as a scientist; and returning to school to study architecture. After graduating, she worked for several small architecture firms and fulfilled a lifelong goal by opening her own firm, Bluewater Architects, before joining the GSA. She discusses the challenges of being a woman architect and managing large construction projects for the government."
