        "Like books and magazines in the Library's general collections, this set of websites complements the original and historical visual material held in the Prints &amp; Photographs Division. Included are sites for photographers and cartoonists represented in P&amp;P (e.g., Kuper, Prokudin-Gorskii, Rogovin, and Telnaes). Also, websites for new digital image formats (e.g., Wrist photography, Reicholdarts cell phone photos, and Micah Wright remix posters). Other sites document new ways of displaying the visual arts through virtual galleries (e.g., Alternative Museum) and new ways of representing architectural work and the built environment (e.g., McKissack, Pritzker Prize, Vergara's Invincible Cities, and Vi&#241;oly). Major then-current event themes include views of Kurdistan and the Iraq War."

The event featured French Canadian fiddle tunes and songs performed by four musicians, Patrick Ross, Jean Nil Theroux, Dalton Binette, and Bow Thayer, who hail from the northernmost area of New Hampshire, adjacent to the Canadian border, across which people and cultural influences have flowed steadily over the last hundred years or more. Percussion includes spoons, and clogging or podorhythm."

        "In this survey of the public, we find Americans prize public library service and see libraries as potential solutions to many communities' most pressing problems, from universal access to computers to the need for better options for keeping teens safe and productive. But few Americans are aware of the increasingly tenuous financial picture faced by many libraries. Forty-five percent give an \"A\" to their local community for maintaining well-run libraries, far ahead of any other community institutions, including schools, parks and police. Those who think public libraries are primarily used by folks who can't afford bookstores are clearly mistaken -- higher-income families are even more likely to use public libraries than low-income families. Prepared with support from the Americans for Libraries Council and funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."

The store was built by a black architect, and Kenneth worked there for 42 years. He speaks about the detrimental affect the freeway (urban renewal) has had on their business. The siblings discuss other business challenges, including the fact that wine is being sold now in Tennessee grocery stores, and the negative impact that bulk stores and outlets are having on their business. Kenneth talks about the of impact gentrification on their business, and how they are not being included in the development that is currently underway in Nashville. Despite all the obstacles, the business is still going strong and Kenneth credits the success of the business to the steadfast commitment and support of the family."
