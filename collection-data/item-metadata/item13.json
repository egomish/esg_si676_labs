        "Shows portions of southern Maryland and northern Virginia emphasizing Winchester, Va.  Sneden notes on the map that Winchester was a city that changed hands 46 times during the war.  He lists three major battles near Winchester, fought in March 1862, May 1864, and September 1864.  Sneden considered the Battle of Kernstown, Va., to be the First Battle of Winchester but today historians consider the First Battle of Winchester to have been fought on May 25, 1862.  Sneden was incorrect on the May 1864 date since the Second Battle of Winchester was fought in June 1863."
