It is best to contact reference staff in advance (see: <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/address.html\">https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/address.html</a>) to make sure the material is on site.  OR </li>\r\n\t<li>P&amp;P reading room staff can provide up to 15 quick copies of  items per calendar year (many original items in the holdings are too old  or fragile to make such copies, but generally HABS/HAER/HALS materials  are in good enough condition to be placed on photocopy machines). For  assistance, see our <a href=\"https://ask.loc.gov/prints-photographs/\">Ask a Librarian</a> page OR </li>\r\n\t<li>Hire a freelance researcher to do further selection for you (a list of researchers in available at: <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/resource/013_pic.html\">https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/resource/013_pic.html</a>). </li>\r\n\t<li>You can purchase copies of various types, including quick  copies, through Library of Congress Duplication Services (price lists,  contact information, and order forms for Library of Congress Duplication  Services are available on the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/preserv/pds/\">Duplication Services Web site</a>): </li>\r\n\t<ul class=\"plain margin-bottom-single-li\">\r\n\t\t<li>Make note of the Call Number listed above. </li>\r\n\t\t<li>Look at the Medium field above. If it lists more than one item: </li>\r\n\t\t<ul class=\"plain margin-bottom-single-li\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>The entire group can be ordered as photocopies or high-quality copies. </li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>All the items in a particular medium (e.g., all drawings, all  photographs) can be ordered as photocopies or high-quality copies. </li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
