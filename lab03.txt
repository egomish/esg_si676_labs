1.  Use the dig command to query umich.edu. What is the response and how would you explain it?
    The important part of the response is the two IP addresses in the ANSWER section: 162.159.140.37 and 172.66.0.37. I guess U-M runs two DNS servers.

2.  Use the command for the above response, and pipe the output to a file named umich-dns-record.txt. Provide the text file.
    See file: https://github.com/egomish/esg_si676_labs/blob/main/umich-dns-record.txt

3.  Use the dig command to query umich.edu. What is the command to return only the “answer” section of the response?
    dig +noall +answer umich.edu
